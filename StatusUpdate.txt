//hardest part was setting the board based on the guess
//kept on messing up string vs char
//set code based on randomized numbers; still need to make it so that there are no repeats 
//keeping of each method; getting it straight for which method does what and rearranging it in tester class
//keeping track of even vs odd arrays; keeping track of which array does what
//coded user guess, print board method, and set code method
//user guess was the most challenging
//array vs array list; comparing ints vs strings
