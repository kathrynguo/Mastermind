//hardest part was setting the board based on the guess
//kept on messing up string vs char
//set code based on randomized numbers; still need to make it so that there are no repeats 
//keeping of each method; getting it straight for which method does what and rearranging it in tester class
//keeping track of even vs odd arrays; keeping track of which array does what
//coded user guess, print board method, and set code method
//user guess was the most challenging
//array vs array list; comparing ints vs strings

Challenges
1. Repeats in code
  Originally, would double count guesses because used contains method
  Ex if the code was RGYB and I guessed GGGG would have 1 Black and 2 Whites
  Then I changed it so that if there were more appearances of the letter in the guess than in the code, it wouldn't place the pin
  Which worked 90% of the time
  But then it would miss some letters
  EX if the code was ROBO and I guessed OOOP; it would place 1 Black but no whites
  Which is why doing the repeats was a problem 
  Evenutally I just changed it to no repeats
2. Do while loop 
  Spent 30 minutes trying to figure out why my do while loop was inifinite
  It's because I typed it wrong
  do {
  }while( a == true); is the correct syntax
  I typed
  do {
  } while(a = true); 
 3. Making it stop when you guessed correctly but still had turns left
  Had to change to a boolean method
  Couldn't figure out why there were out of bounds errors until realized that typing m1.check() calls it every time
  So doing
  m1.check(win); 
  if (m1.check(win) == true) {
  else if (m1.check(win) == false) {
  calls it three times
  
  So really you have to do
  if (m1.check(win) == true) {
  }
  else {
  }
 4. Adding print statement to trace helps you diagnose problems
